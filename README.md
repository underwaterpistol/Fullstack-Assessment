# Fullstack-Assessment

In order to assess your suitability for a fullstack developer position at Underwaterpistol we have asked that you complete a short assessment. Your task is to build a `HTTP REST API` that fulfils the requirements set out in the documentation below - you should also include an `index.html` file that connects to your API and lists all records, the specific design of this page is not important but you should attempt to style it with the included `app.scss` file.

Your API can be built with node.js but we ask that the frontend only uses vanilla Javascript with no libraries or frameworks. Please use the included `app.js` file for frontend script.

We recommend using the live sass compiler extension in VSCode.

This assessment should take between 60 and 90 minutes to complete.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repo locally (do not fork)
2. Create a new public repo on GitHub
3. Change your local remote to your new repository
4. Complete the assessment
5. Submit a link to your repository to Underwaterpistol

## Criteria 

Areas that we will use to assess your suitability include the following:
* Demonstration of git knowledge
* Maintainability of code
* Optimization strategies
* Capabilities with your chosen backend language
* Usage of semantic HTML elements
* Usage of Sass and BEM principles
* Usage of ES6 and otherwise suitable javascript
* Bonus points for frontend flair - e.g. loading states
